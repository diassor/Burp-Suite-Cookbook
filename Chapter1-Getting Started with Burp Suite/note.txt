Chapter 1. Getting Started with Burp Suite

In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:

    Downloading Burp (Community, Professional)
    Setting up a web app pentesting lab
    Starting Burp at a command line or an executable
    Listening for HTTP traffic, using Burp

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting up a web app pentesting lab

The Broken Web Application (BWA) is an OWASP project that provides a self-contained VM complete with a variety of
applications with known vulnerabilities.

The applications within this VM enable students to learn about web application security, practice and observe web attacks, and make use of penetration tools such as Burp.

To follow the recipes shown in this book, we will utilize OWASP's BWA VM. At the time of this writing, the OWASP BWA VM
can be downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/owaspbwa/files/.

last downloaded owaspbwa we used app-cl1.vmdk
and make a virtualbox machine and we used ubuntun(64-bit)
    use an existing web App-cl1.vmdk(normal, 8.00 Gb)
        create
    and network use Host-only Adapter
        virtualbox host-only Ethernet Adapter
        start
            username - root
            password = owaspbwa
                check the ip before and keep
we use mutillidae

Starting Burp at a command line or as an executable

I'am used a professional version of burp suite with
shell = java -jar burpsuite-loadar.jar cracket of password
and run , before i eraeser the las version burp installed in
kali for fac . and paste de new version downloaded

Listening for HTTP traffic, using Burp
    I used the bug firefox

Burp is described as an intercepting proxy. This means Burp sits between the user's web browser and the application's web
server and intercepts or captures all of the traffic flowing between them. This type of behavior is commonly referred to
as a Proxy service.

Penetration testers use intercepting proxies to capture traffic flowing between a web browser and a web application
for the purposes of analysis and manipulation.
    For example, a tester can pause any HTTP request, thus allowing parameter tampering prior to sending the request to the web server.

Intercepting proxies, such as Burp, allow testers to intercept both HTTP requests and HTTP responses.

This allows a tester to observe the behavior of the web application under different conditions.
And, as we shall see, sometimes, the behaviors are unintended from what the original developer expected.

To see the Burp suite in action, we need to configure our Firefox browser's Network Settings to point to our running
instance of Burp.

This enables Burp to capture all HTTP traffic that is flowing between your browser and the target web application.

The following are the steps you can go through to listen to all HTTP traffic using Burp:

    1 =  Open the Firefox browser and go to Options.
    2 =  In the General tab, scroll down to the Network Proxy
            section and then click Settings.
    3 =     In the Connection Settings, select Manual proxy configuration and type in the IP address of 127.0.0.1 with
    port 8080.
    Select theUse this proxy server for all protocols checkbox:

How it works...

    The Burp Proxy service is listening on 127.0.0.1 port 8080.
    Either of these settings can be changed to listen on an alternative IP address or port number.
    However, for the purpose of learning, we will use the default settings.
