Introduction

This chapter covers techniques used to bypass and assess session management schemes.
Session management schemes are used by applications to keep track of user activity, usually by means of session tokens.
Web assessments of session management also involve determining the strength of session tokens used and whether those tokens are
properly protected.
We will learn how to use Burp to perform such tests.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Testing session token strength using Sequencer

To track user activity from page to page within an application, developers create and assign unique session token values to each
user.
Most session token mechanisms include session IDs, hidden form fields, or cookies.
Cookies are placed within the user's browser on the client-side.

These session tokens should be examined by a penetration tester
to ensure their uniqueness, randomness, and cryptographic strength, to prevent information leakage.

If a session token value is easily guessable(adivinable) or remains unchanged after login, an attacker could apply (or
fixate) a pre-known token value to a user. This is known as a session fixation attack.
Generally speaking, the purpose of the attack is to harvest(cosechar) sensitive data in the user's account, since the
session token is known to the attacker.


Getting ready

    We'll check the session tokens used in OWASP Mutillidae II to ensure they are created in a secure and an unpredictable way.
    An attacker who is able to predict and forge a weak session token can perform session fixation attacks.


How to do it...

    Ensure(asegurar) Burp and the OWASP BWA VM are running and that Burp is configured in the Firefox browser used to view OWASP BWA applications.

    1=  From the OWASP BWA Landing page, click the link to the
        OWASP Mutillidae II application.

    2=  Open the Firefox browser to access the home page of OWASP
        Mutillidae II (URL:  http://<your_VM_assigned_IP_address>/mutillidae/).
        Make sure you are starting a fresh session of the Mutillidae application and not logged into it already:

    3=  Switch to the Proxy | HTTP History tab and select the
        request showing your initial browse to the Mutillidae home page.

    4=  Look for the GET (mutillidae)request and the associated
        response containing the Set-Cookie: assignments.
        Whenever you see this assignment, you can ensure you are getting a freshly created cookie for your session.
        Specifically, we are interested in the PHPSESSID cookie value:

    5=  Highlight the value of the of the PHPSESSID cookie, right-
        click, and select Send to Sequencer:


Sequencer is a tool within Burp designed to determine the strength or the quality of the randomness created within a
session token.

    6=  After sending the value of the PHPSESSID parameter over
        to Sequencer, you will see the value loaded in the Select Live Capture Request(subtab) table.

    7=  Before pressing the Start live capturebutton, scroll down
        to theToken Location Within Response section.

        In the Cookie dropdown list, select PHPSESSID=<captured session token value>:

    8=  Since we have the correct cookie value selected, we can
        begin the live capture process.
        Click the Start live capture button, and Burp will send
        multiple requests, extracting the PHPSESSID cookie out of
        each response.
        After each capture, Sequencer performs a statistical analysis of the level of randomness in each token.

    9=  Allow the capture to gather and analyze at least 200
        tokens, but feel free to let it run longer if you like:

    10=  Once you have at least 200 samples, click the Analyze
         now button.
         Whenever you are ready to stop the capturing process, press the Stop button and confirm Yes:

    11=  After the analysis is complete, the output of Sequencer
        provides an overall(en general) result.

        In this case, the quality of randomness(aleatoriedad) for the PHPSESSID session token is excellent.
        The amount of effective entropy(entreopia) is estimated to be 112 bits.
        From a web pentester perspective, these session tokens are very strong, so there is no vulnerability to report
        here.
        However, though there is no vulnerability present, it is good practice to perform such checks on session tokens:


How it works...

    To better understand the math and hypothesis behind Sequencer, consult Portswigger's documentation on the topic
    here: https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/sequencer/tests.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Testing for cookie attributes

Important user-specific information, such as session tokens, is often stored in cookies within the client browser.
Due to their importance, cookies need to be protected from malicious attacks.
This protection usually comes in the form of two flags—secure and HttpOnly.

The secure flag informs the browser to only send the cookie to
the web server if the protocol is encrypted (for example, HTTPS, TLS).
This flag protects the cookie from eavesdropping over(escuchando a escondidas) unencrypted channels.

The HttpOnly flag instructs the browser to not allow access or manipulation of the cookie via JavaScript.
This flag protects the cookie from cross-site scripting attacks.


Getting ready

    Check the cookies used in the OWASP Mutillidae II application, to ensure the presence of protective flags.

    Since the Mutillidae application runs over an unencrypted channel (for example, HTTP), we can only check for the presence of the HttpOnly flag.
    Therefore(por lo tanto), the secure flag is out of scope for this recipe.


How to do it...

    Ensure Burp and OWASP BWA VM are running and that Burp is configured in the Firefox browser used to view OWASP BWA applications.

    1=  From the OWASP BWA Landing page, click the link to the
        OWASP Mutillidae II application.

    2=  Open the Firefox Browser, to access the home page of
        OWASP Mutillidae II (URL:  http://<your_VM_assigned_IP_address>/mutillidae/).

        Make sure you are starting a fresh session and you are not logged in to the Mutillidae application:
            http://127.0.0.1/mutillidae/


    3=  Switch to the Proxy | HTTP history tab, and select the
        request showing your initial browse to the Mutillidae home page.
        Look for the GET request and its associated response containing Set-Cookie: assignments.
        Whenever you see this assignment, you can ensure you are getting a freshly created cookie for your session. Specifically, we are interested in the PHPSESSID cookie value.

    4=  Examine the end of the Set-Cookie: assignments lines.
        Notice the absence of the HttpOnly flag for both lines. This means the PHPSESSID and showhints cookie values are
        not protected from JavaScript manipulation.
        This is a security finding that you would include in your report:

            Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=dd00f6bb5aeb9d97fccfe3d818b46012; path=/

            Set-Cookie: showhints=1


How it works...

        If the two cookies had HttpOnly flags set, the flags would appear at the end of the Set-Cookie assignment lines.
        When present, the flag would immediately follow a semicolon ending the path scope of the cookie, followed by the string HttpOnly.
        The display is similar for the Secure flag as well:

        Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=<session token value>;path=/;Secure;HttpOnly;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Testing for session fixation

Session tokens are assigned to users for tracking purposes.
This means that when browsing an application as unauthenticated, a user is assigned a unique session ID, which is usually stored
in a cookie.
Application developers should always create a new session token after the user logs into the website.
If this session token does not change, the application could be susceptible to a session fixation attack.
It is the responsibility of web penetration testers to determine whether this token changes values from an unauthenticated state to an authenticated state.

Session fixation is present when application developers do not invalidate the unauthenticated session token, allowing the user
to use the same one after authentication.
This scenario allows an attacker with a stolen session token to masquerade as(disfrazarse de) the user.


Getting ready

    Using the OWASP Mutillidae II application and Burp's Proxy HTTP History and Comparer, we will examine unauthenticated PHPSESSID session token value.
    Then, we will log in to the application and compare the unauthenticated value against the authenticated value to determine the presence of the session fixation vulnerability.


How to do it...

    1=  Navigate to the login screen (click Login/Register from
        the top menu), but do not log in yet.

    2=  Switch to Burp's ProxyHTTP history tab, and look for the
        GET request showing when you browsed to the login screen.
        Make a note of the value assigned to the PHPSESSID parameter placed within a cookie:

    3=  Right-click the PHPSESSID parameter and send the request
        to Comparer:

    4=  Return to the login screen (click Login/Register from
        the top menu), and, this time, log in under the username ed and the password pentest.

    5=  After logging in, switch to Burp's ProxyHTTP history
        tab.
        Look for the POST request showing your login (for example, the 302 HTTP status code) as well as the
        immediate GET request following the POST.
        Note the PHPSESSID assigned after login. Right-click and send this request to Comparer.

    6=  Switch to Burp's Comparer.
        The appropriate requests should already be highlighted for you.
        Click the Words button in the bottom right-hand corner:


A popup shows a detailed comparison of the differences between the two requests.
Note the value of PHPSESSID does not change between the unauthenticated session (on the left) and the authenticated session (on the right).
This means the application has a session fixation vulnerability:


    GET /mutillidae/index.php?popUpNotificationCode=AU1 HTTP/1.1
            autenticado
        Cookie: showhints=1; username=ed; uid=23; PHPSESSID=f9809beb5bb9d2dfb78f9927d82298bd
        Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1


    GET /mutillidae/index.php?page=login.php HTTP/1.1
            no autenticado
        Cookie: showhints=1; PHPSESSID=f9809beb5bb9d2dfb78f9927d82298bd
        Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

How it works...

    In this recipe, we examined how the PHPSESSID value assigned to an unauthenticated user remained constant even after
    authentication.
    This is a security vulnerability allowing for the session fixation attack.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Testing for exposed session variables

Session variables such as tokens, cookies, or hidden form fields
are used by application developers to send data between the client and the server.
Since these variables are exposed on the client-side, an
attacker can manipulate them in an attempt to gain access to unauthorized data or to capture sensitive information.

Burp's Proxy option provides a feature to enhance the visibility of so-called hidden form fields.
This feature allows web application penetration testers to determine the level of the sensitivity of data held in these
variables.
Likewise(igualmente), a pentester can determine whether the manipulation of these values produces a different behavior in the application.


Getting ready

    Using the OWASP Mutillidae II application and Burp's Proxy's Unhide hidden form fields feature, we'll determine whether
    manipulation of a hidden form field value results in gaining access to unauthorized data.


How to do it...

    1=  Switch to Burp's Proxy tab, scroll down to the
        Response Modification section, and check the boxes for Unhide hidden form fields and Prominently highlight unhidden fields:

    2=  Navigate to the User Info page.
        OWASP 2017 | A1 – Injection (SQL) | SQLi – Extract Data | User Info (SQL):

    3=  Note the hidden form fields now prominently displayed on
        the page:
                Hidden field [page] [user-info.php]

    4=  Let's try to manipulate the value shown, user-info.php,
        by changing it to admin.php and see how the application reacts.
        Modify the user-info.php to admin.php within the Hidden field [page] textbox:

    5=  Hit the Enter key after making the change.
        You should now see a new page loaded showing PHP Server Configuration information:
            PHP Version 7.3.7 and more info about my system



How it works...

    As seen in this recipe, there isn't anything hidden about hidden form fields.
    As penetration testers, we should examine and manipulate these values, to determine whether sensitive information is,
    inadvertently, exposed or whether we can change the behavior
    of the application from what is expected, based on our role
    and authentication status.
    In the case of this recipe, we were not even logged into the application.
    We manipulated the hidden form field labeled page to access a page containing fingerprinting information.
    Access to such information should be protected from unauthenticated users.

Testing for Cross-Site Request Forgery

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that rides on an authenticated user's session to allow an attacker to force the
user to execute unwanted actions on the attacker's behalf.(nombre del atacante)

The initial lure(senuelo) for this attack can be a phishing email or a malicious link executing through a cross-site
scripting vulnerability found on the victim's website.
CSRF exploitation may lead to a data breach or even a full compromise of the web application


Getting ready

    Using the OWASP Mutillidae II application registration form, determine whether a CSRF attack is possible within the same
    browser (a different tab) while an authenticated user is logged into the application.


How to do it...

    To level set this recipe, let's first baseline the current number of records in the account table and perform SQL Injection to see this:

    1=  Navigate to the User Info page: OWASP 2017 | A1 –
        Injection (SQL) | SQLi – Extract Data | User Info (SQL).

    2=  At the username prompt, type in a SQL Injection payload
        to dump the entire account table contents.
        The payload is ' or 1=1-- <space>  (tick or 1 equals 1 dash dash space).
        Then press the View Account Details button.

    3=  Remember to include the space after the two dashes,
        since this is a MySQL database;
            otherwise, the payload will not work:

Results for "' or 1=1-- ".23 records found.

            Username=admin
            Password=adminpass
            Signature=g0t r00t?

            Username=adrian
            Password=somepassword
            Signature=Zombie Films Rock!

We confirmed 23 records currently exist in the accounts table of the database.

    4=  When performed correctly, a message displays that there
        are 23 records found in the database for users.
        The data shown following the message reveals the usernames, passwords, and signature strings of all 23 accounts.
        Only two account details are shown here as a sample:

    5=  Now, return to the login screen (click Login/Register
        from the top menu) and select the link Please register here.

    6=  After clicking the Please register herelink, you are
        presented with a registration form.

    7=  Fill out the form to create a tester account.
        Type in the Username as tester, the Password as tester, and the Signature as This is a tester account:

    8=  After clicking the Create Account button, you should
        receive a green banner confirming the account was created:

            Account created for tester. 1 rows inserted.

    9=  Return to the User Info page: OWASP 2017| A1 – Injection
        (SQL) | SQLi – Extract Data | User Info (SQL).

    10= Perform the SQL Injection attack again and verify that
        you can now see 24 rows in the account table, instead of the previous count of 23:

             Results for "' or 1=1-- ".24 records found.

             Username=tester
             Password=tester
             Signature=This is a tester account


    11= Switch to Burp's Proxy HTTP history tab and view the
        POST request that created the account for the tester.

    12= Studying this POST request shows the POST action
        (register.php) and the body data required to perform the
        action, in this case, username, password,
        confirm_password, and my_signature.
        Also notice there is no CSRF-token used.
        CSRF-tokens are placed within web forms to protect against the very attack we are about to perform.
            Let's proceed.

        csrf-token=&username=tester&password=tester&confirm_password=tester&my_signature=This+is+a+tester+account&register-php-submit-button=Create+Account

    13=  Right-click the POST request and click on Send to
        Repeater:

    14=  If you're using Burp Professional, right-click select
         Engagement tools | Generate CSRF PoC:

    15=  Upon clicking this feature, a pop-up box generates the
         same form used on the registration page but without any CSRF token protection:

    16=  If you are using Burp Community, you can easily
         recreate the CSRF PoC form by viewing the source code of the registration page:
            click right and select View Page Source

    17=  While viewing the page source, scroll down to the
         <form> tag section.
         For brevity, the form is recreated next.
         Insert attacker as a value for the username, password, and the signature.
         Copy the following HTML code and save it in a file entitled csrf.html:


<html>
  <body>
  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <form action="http://192.168.56.101/mutillidae/index.php?page=register.php" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="csrf-token" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="username" value="attacker" />
      <input type="hidden" name="password" value="attacker" />
      <input type="hidden" name="confirm_password" value="attacker"
/>      <input type="hidden" name="my_signature" value="attacker account" />
      <input type="hidden" name="register-php-submit-button" value="Create Account" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

    18=  Now, return to the login screen (click Login/Register
        from the top menu), and log in to the application, using the username ed and the password pentest.

    19= Open the location on your machine where you saved the
        csrf.html file.
        Drag the file into the browser where ed is authenticated.
        After you drag the file to this browser, csrf.html will appear as a separate tab in the same browser:

    20= For demonstration purposes, there is a Submit request
        button.
        However, in the wild, a JavaScript function would automatically execute the action of creating an account
        for the attacker.
        Click the Submit request button:

            Account created for atacante. 1 rows inserted

    21=  Switch to Burp's Proxy | HTTP history tab and find the
         maliciously executed POST used to create the account
         for the attacker, while riding on the authenticated session of ed's:

    22=  Return to the User Info page: OWASP 2017 | A1 –
         Injection (SQL) | SQLi – Extract Data | User Info (SQL), and perform the SQL Injection attack again.

         You will now see 25 rows in the account table instead of the previous count of 24:
             Results for "' or 1=1-- ".25 records found.


How it works...

    CSRF attacks require an authenticated user session to surreptitiously perform actions within the application on
    behalf of the attacker.
    In this case, an attacker rides on ed's session to re-run the registration form, to create an account for the attacker.
    If ed had been an admin, this could have allowed the account role to be elevated as well.
